## Impact of artifact removal on ChIP quality metrics in ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo data

*Abstract* The idea is investigate the effects of blacklisting and duplicated reads on established metrics of ChIP-seq quality. There is also a first application of these metrics to ChIP-Exo data, and some recommendations.

### Blacklists:

The authors considered 3 blacklisted regions from where the first two can be downloaded from the UCSC genome browser
