There were 50 or more warnings (use warnings() to see the first 50)
Error in intersect(repl[[w]], finalsetini) : 
  error in evaluating the argument 'x' in selecting a method for function 'intersect': Error in repl[[w]] : subscript out of bounds    

## the error in the code seems to come from this, which makes me think that only works for mode than one replicate

finalset <- repl[[1]]
    for (w in 2:NT) {
        finalsetini <- finalset
        finalset <- intersect(repl[[w]], finalsetini)
    }
