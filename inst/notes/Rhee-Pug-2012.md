## ChIP - Exo: A Method to identify Genomic location of DNA - binding proteins at Near Single nucleotide accuracy

This paper decribes the experimental detaills of their method. The ChIP Exo process is summarized by:

1. The process is initiated by cross - linking DNA and associated proteins
2. The chromatin is isolated from the nuclei and subjected to sonication
3. An antibody against a specfic protein is used to inmuno - precipitate specific DNA - protein complexes
4. ChIP DNA is purified, sequencing adaptors are ligated 
5. and then digested by lambda exonuclease
6. Then is subjected to high throughout sequencing, which generated 25 - 50 bp fragments
