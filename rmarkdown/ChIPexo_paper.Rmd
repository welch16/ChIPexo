# Introduction

  


## What is ChIPexo ?

<!-- Here I am thinking to write the first section of the poster, which was -->
<!-- based on the Mendenhall and Bernstein note on Genome Biology -->

<!-- this paper need to include the analysis of the paper that dongjun made -->



### Literature review



#### ChIPexo related methods

<!-- About ChIPexo, there are: -->
<!-- CexoR -->
<!-- MACE -->
<!-- GEM (I think this two are the same) -->


#### ChIPseq methods used with ChIPexo

<!-- Some ChIPseq peak callers are used with ChIPexo regardless of they -->
<!-- work or not. Need to check which ones, if they work and if not perhaps -->
<!-- propose -->


### Biases present in ChIPexo data

#### Strand imbalance

#### Sequence digestion bias



### Reproducibility analysis

### Between protocols (ChIPseq vs ChIPexo)
### Between biological replicates




### Discussion

<!-- Here we are supposed to write the analysis that we made, the quality -->
<!-- control pipeline and how our claims were validated -->


### Conclusions


### Bibliography
